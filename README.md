# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and the Tkinter library. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## How to Play

1. Run the script using the following command:


2. The game window will open, displaying an empty 3x3 grid.
3. Player 1 will be randomly assigned either 'X' or 'O' to start the game.
4. Each player takes turns by clicking on an empty cell in the grid.
5. The objective is to get three marks of the same type in a row, column, or diagonal.
6. The game ends when a player wins or the entire grid is filled without a winner.
7. The winning player's marks will be highlighted in green.
8. If there is a tie (all cells are filled without a winner), it will be indicated as a tie game.
9. To start a new game, click the "Restart" button.
